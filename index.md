Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 5 part 1
This was one of my favorite labs because it was very straight forward. Me and my partner had to calculate the rectangle. We also had to declare the two interger variables and then intialize them as 0.Although it was very difficult at times it helped me learn the user input in variable declaration.

Lab 1 part 1
This was on my favorite labs because it introduced me into declaring the string variables. My partner and I defined these variables in the beginning. I also learned how to push the commands and comment.My favorite part was when I tested the code to see if it worked.
